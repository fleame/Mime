\arguments{
\item{res.by.ML.Dev.Prog.Sig}{The results of function ML.Dev.Prog.Sig}

\item{train_data}{The training data using in ML.Dev.Prog.Sig}

\item{inputmatrix.list}{A list contain the data frames (colnames:ID,OS.time,OS,other variables), log2(x+1)ï¼Œ OS.time(day), OS(0/1)}

\item{mode}{Choose MF models: 'all', 'single', 'double'}

\item{single_ml}{If the mode is set to "single", you must fill in the following models: c("RSF", "Enet", "StepCox","CoxBoost","plsRcox","superpc","GBM","survivalsvm","Ridge","Lasso").}

\item{double_ml1}{If the mode is set to "double", you need to fill in the modeling methods here: c('RSF', "StepCox","CoxBoost","Lasso").}

\item{double_ml2}{If the mode is set to "double", you need to fill in the modeling methods here: c("RSF", "Enet", "StepCox","CoxBoost","plsRcox","superpc","GBM","survivalsvm","Ridge","Lasso")}

\item{alpha_for_Enet}{One of the values from 0.1 to 0.9. c(0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9). There are some conditions you could not set this parameter. [1] The mode is 'all'. [2] The mode is 'single' or 'double', but the 'Enet' is not included in the algorithms you choose.}

\item{direction_for_stepcox}{The parameter for the StepCox. One  from "both", "backward", "forward". There are some conditions you could not set this parameter. [1] The mode is 'all'. [2] The mode is 'single' or 'double', but the 'StepCox' is not included in the algorithms you choose.}
}
\value{
